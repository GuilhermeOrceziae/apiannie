Api Annie helps your team to co-ordinate easier when developing a product which needs API comunication, by going through the following steps:
1. Define your API documentation
2. Frontend developer makes their prototype by using the mock server automatically generated by Api Annie.
3. Backend developer builds the backend services and test it by sending requests through Api Annie
4. When both frontend and backend development are finished, let frontend switch communication from Api Annie to your backend server URL.
